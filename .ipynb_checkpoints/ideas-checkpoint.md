## Questions
### For Food:
1. How does cuisine differ from each culture?
- While some cultures use similar ingredients, all of their cuisine is unique in some way with recipes being passed down from each generation prior.
2. What is the cultural significance of food for different countries?
### For Art:
1. How does Bob Ross create such intricate pieces of art by only using small, simple techniques?
2. What is the importance of this simplicity to the art world?
- Bob Ross prefered simplicity in his art over elaborate work, which is why he never included people or chimneys(since he believed that they represented people). He wanted to create a way for people with minimal art skills to create elegant art in the easiest ways.
